Although this leads to higher system throughput, the performance of individual tasks might fluctuate beyond desired levels. We aim to find a program’s optimal performance by analyzing a series of user-space tasks running at different priority levels in a Linux operating system. In our research, we have chosen to gauge optimal performance by a task’s total execution time and the number of context switches. The priority levels are determined by the user-space task’s “nice” value within the Linux kernel. With these defined performance values our systematic approach becomes clear: calculate the optimal nice by analyzing the lowest number of context switches and task completion time. In addition, the OS would apply the optimal nice value to the process in real-time while the process is actively running.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"taskreprioritizer"}}
