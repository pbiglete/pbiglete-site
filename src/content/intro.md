I completed my Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from San Diego State University on December 2018. I am currently seeking full-time employment as a Software Engineer. I am currently interested in doing full stack development as it will utilize my creativeness from my digital art background and solid programming skills to create a well-designed product.
